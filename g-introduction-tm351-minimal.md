# Introduction

In this module, you will use a module specific virtualised computing environment (VCE) for some of the module activities. We offer two ways of accessing the VCE: as an online hosted version using the Open University's OpenComputing Lab service (the 'hosted VCE'), and as a locally run environment that you can install on your own computer (a 'local VCE').

*In the first instance, you are encouraged to work with the hosted environment.*

The VCE provides a customised computing environment appropriate for your module and an interactive browser based user interface to access the software running inside it. The VCE is implemented using the widely supported containers approach. The hosted and local VCEs provide an identical environment.

The hosted VCE is straightforward to use, and is suitable for most students ([OpenComputing Lab Official Documentation](https://docs.ocl.open.ac.uk/container-launcher/user/)). The hosted VCE can be accessed from the link provided in the `Resources` tab on the {{MCODE}} VLE website. *If you want to use the VCE when you do not have a connection to the Internet, or if you want to gain experience of installing and running a virtualised Linux-based computing environment using containers, then you should choose to download and install the local VCE ([](g-local_vce_quickstart.md#local-vce-quick-start))*. Further advice on choosing between the two environments is provided in {numref}`hosted-or-vce` {ref}`hosted-or-vce`.

Your work in the VCE will be saved within the environment: either in the cloud (by the hosted VCE) or on your local machine (by the local VCE). If you are using the hosted VCE, you should regularly download a copy of your work files, particularly any TMA and EMA related work, to your local machine. For the local VCE, you might also want to back up important files to an alternative location.

## How the VCE computing guide is structured

*This guide includes information regarding the internals of the {{MCODE}} VCE. For guidance on using the VCE, see the [OpenComputing Lab Official Documentation](https://docs.ocl.open.ac.uk/container-launcher/user/).*

### Essential information provided inside this software guide:

- working with JupyterLab, including uploading and downloading files ({numref}`g-vce_homepage_jupyterlab.md#using-the-vce-with-jupyterlab`)

- working with Jupyter notebooks — a brief overview of working within a Jupyter notebook document ({numref}`g-working_with_jupyter_notebooks.md#working-with-jupyter-notebooks`) as well as notebook "gotchas" - that is, features of the notebooks that may not work the way you expect

- additional software applications provided in the VCE that are specific to {{MCODE}} (OpenRefine, PostgreSQL and MongoDB) {numref}`x-tm351-extras.md#additional-software` {ref}`x-tm351-extras.md#additional-software`

- information on finding additional support, and guidance on where to look for or ask for help ({numref}`g-additional-support.md#additional-support`)

- troubleshooting ({numref}`g-troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting`)

### Reference information (refer to this as required):

- accessibility information ({numref}`g-accessibility_jupyterlab-nbv7.md#jupyter-notebook-accessibility`) (includes selecting language packs, changing theme, setting font sizes, enabling audio alerts, etc.)

- advanced file management — further guidance on how to upload, backup and download files, create and uncompress `.zip` file archives, etc. ({numref}`g-file_management.md#file-management`)

### Advanced user information:

- practical advice on using the Linux terminal / command line ({numref}`g-using-linux-command-line.md#using-the-terminal-command-line` {ref}`g-using-linux-command-line.md#using-the-terminal-command-line`)

- working with `git` and remote `git` repositories in {numref}`g-jupyterlab_git.md#using-git-and-github-in-jupyterlab` {ref}`g-jupyterlab_git.md#using-git-and-github-in-jupyterlab`. 

- (optional) choosing between the hosted or local VCE ({numref}`hosted-or-vce`) and guidance on installing the local VCE on your own computer, including testing your installation ({numref}`g-local_vce_quickstart.md#local-vce-quick-start` and {numref}`g-local_vce_detailed.md#local-vce-detailed-guidance`)
