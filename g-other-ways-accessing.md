# Other Ways of Accessing the VCE

As well as the Open University *OpenComputing Lab* hosted VCEs and locally run VCEs, there are various other ways in which you can connect to or access a VCE:

- connect to a Jupyter kernel running inside a local VCE from VS Code;
- run a VCE container as a `.devcontainer` inside VS Code on your own computer;
- launch a VCE container in the cloud using GitHub Codespaces.
