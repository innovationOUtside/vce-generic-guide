# Compute Home online VCE

The Compute Home online hosted VCE is provides the simplest way of accessing a module's VCE. No local software installation is required other than a modern web browser, although you will need an internet connection  to access the service. In principle, you should be able to access the online VCE using a smartphone or tablet device as well as a laptop or desktop computer. However, you may find the screen size and on-screen keyboard a limiting factor on usability when using mobile devices. We recommend the use of the Chrome web browser for using the Compute Home online VCE.

See the central *OpenComputing Lab* documentation here: https://docs.ocl.open.ac.uk/container-launcher/user/

A link to the online Compute Home service will be typically be found on the module website in the *Resources* section, often under the heading *Computing Resources*. For modules where the VCE is only required in a particular study block, the *Computing Resources* may appear in a particular block resources section. Click the *Compute Home* link to get started. You should see an entry for your particular module. For example, {numref}`your_compute_home_page` shows a VCE launcher link for the October 2021 presentation of the TM129 module.

Click the *Start* button for the *{{mnamecode}} {{PCODE}}* VCE to launch the environment.

You may have to wait for several minutes while the environment is set up for you, {numref}`wait_on_vce_start`. On subsequent visits, access will be quicker.

Waiting while the VCE is set up

Once the VCE has loaded, you will be presented with the VCE homepage as described in the section *Using the VCE*.
