# Additional Software

The {{MCODE}} ({{PCODE}}) VCE contains several applications and services in addition to the Jupyter environment, in particular:

- *Open Refine*, a graphical application for cleaning and manipulating tabular data sets;
- *PostgreSQL* database management system;
- *MongoDB* database.

## Working with OpenRefine

OpenRefine is a powerful application for cleaning messy data, which we will use later in the module. OpenRefine can be started from the JupyterLab launcher, {numref}`jl_openrefine_launcher`.

OpenRefine provides a browser based user interface that allows you to upload and clean tabular data files.

The OpenRefine application runs in its own browser tab or browser window and should be opened from the JupyterLab *Launcher*.

## Working with PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a widely used open source relational database. PostgreSQL is preinstalled in the {{MCODE}} VCE and should run automatically when the VCE is started.

You will access PostgreSQL from Python code running inside Jupyter notebooks.

By default, you should be able to connect to the database inside the VCE using port `5432`.

Connections to the PostgreSQL database can be made using a connection string with the form:

`postgresql://USER:PWD@HOST:PORT/DB`

The following connection string can be used when connecting to the database:

`PGCONN='postgresql://testuser:testpass@localhost:5432/testdb'`

In a notebook code cell, you can create a database connection as:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine(PGCONN)
```

You can inspect various properties of the database using the `sqlalchemy` inspector. For example, you can view the tables associated with a particular database:

```python
from sqlalchemy import inspect

inspector = inspect(engine)
inspector.get_table_names()
```

You can manage the PostgreSQL server using the following shell commands fron within a terminal running inside the VCE, or prefix the command with a `!` to run it from a Jupyter notebook code cell:

- restart the server: `sudo service postgresql restart`
- start the server: `sudo service postgresql start`
- stop the server: `sudo service postgresql stop`

If you cannot connect to the PostgreSQL database, try restarting using the appropriate command.

You might also want to check that you are trying to connect to the correct port. To check what port PosgreSQL is listening to within the VCE, in a notebook code cell, run:

`! pg_lsclusters`

Or run the command directly on the command line without the initial `!`.

The port should by identifiable near the start of the string (e.g. the `main` cluster running on port `5432`).

If you still cannot connect to the database, try restarting the VCE. (In a local VCE, restart the container from the Docker Desktop.)

###Â Backing up and restoring databases using PostgreSQL

To back up a PostgreSQL database such as a movies database into a folder postgres-backup create a shared `backups` folder, in your {{local_dirname}} shared directory or as {{vce_db_backups}} inside the VCE and run the following command from a Notebook code cell (all on a single line):

```bash
! mkdir -p ~/backups//postgres-backup/
! pg_dump tm351 > ~/backups/postgres-backup/tm351.sql`
```

Note that if the `movies` database does not exist, you will get an error if you try to back it up.

To restore a PostgreSQL database from a previously taken backup, such as a backup of the movies database, run the command (all on a single line):

`! psql tm351    < ~/backups/postgres-backup/tm351.sql`

## Working with MongoDB

MongoDB is a widely used open source "noSQL" document database. MongoDB is preinstalled in the {{MCODE}} VCE and should run automatically when the VCE is started.

You will access MongoDB from Python code running inside Jupyter notebooks.

By default, you should be able to connect to the database inside the VCE using port `27017`.

The following connection string can be used when connecting to the database:

`MONGOCONN='mongodb://localhost:27017'`

You can manage the MongoDB server using the following shell commands fron within a terminal running inside the VCE, or prefix the command with a `!` to run it from a Jupyter notebook code cell:

- restart the server: `sudo service mongod restart`
- start the server: `sudo service mongod start`
- stop the server: `sudo service mongod stop`

If you cannot connect to the MongoDB database, try restarting using the appropriate command.

You might also want to check that you are trying to connect to the correct port. Assuming that the MongoDB server is running using a configuration file in the default location, you can check the configuration file setting to see which port is specified:

`! cat /etc/mongod.conf | grep 'port:'`

You can find the actual location of the configuration file by running the command:

`! ps -xa | grep mongod``

The path to the configuration file is given by the value of the `-f` parameter in the run command:

`/usr/bin/mongod -f /etc/mongod.conf -- run`

If you still cannot connect to the database, try restarting the VCE. (In a local VCE, restart the container from the Docker Desktop.)

### Backing up and restoring databases using MongoDB

To backup a MongoDB database such as the accidents, create a shared `backups` folder, in your {{local_dirname}} shared directory or as {{vce_db_backups}} inside the VCE, and run the following command (all on a single line) from a Notebook code cell:

```bash
! mkdir -p ~/backups//postgres-backup/
! mongodump --port=27017 --db accidents --out ~/backups/mongo-backup/accidents
```

To restore a MongoDB database from a previously taken backup, such as a backup of the accidents database, run the command (all on a single line):

`mongorestore --port=27017 --drop ~/backups/mongo-backup/accidents`
