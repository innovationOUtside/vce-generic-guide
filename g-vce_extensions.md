# VCE Extensions

OU VCEs often make use of off-the-shelf third party extensions, as well as OU developed extensions, to enrich the Jupyter environment.

If you are working in your own Jupyter enviroment and are missing one or more of the features provided by an OU VCE, you can install the missing extension(s) as required.

A wide variety of extensions may be, but not necessarily are, installed into OU VCEs, including, but not limited to, the following:

- the [`jupyterlab_ou_brand_extension`](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/jupyterlab_ou_brand_extension) adds OU logos to the JupyterLab environment.

- the [`jupyterlab_empinken_extension`](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/jupyterlab_empinken_extension) supports thematically coloured background cells that indicate how to interpret different sections of a notebook.

-the [`jupyterlab_cell_status_extension`](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/jupyterlab_cell_status_extension) provides visual and/or audible indications of the cell run status. 

- the [`executablebooks/jupyterlab-myst`](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyterlab-myst) extension supports the rendering of enriched MyST flavoured markdown from notebook markdown cells [[docs](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-jupyter-lab-myst)].

- the [`jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-archive`](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-archive) extension provides a convenient way of downloading and zipping files from a selected directory, {numref}`jl_download_archive`.

- the [`jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-filesystem-access`](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-filesystem-access) extension adds local file system access to the JupyterLab environment (currently, Chrome browser only).

- the [`jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) extension adds various tools to support working with files in `git` managed repositories.
