# Local Filesystem Access

The [`jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-filesystem-access`](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-filesystem-access) extension adds local file system access to the JupyterLab environment (currently, Chrome browser only).

This extension allows you to select a directory from your local filesystem (which is to say, the files on your own computer) and access that directory from within Jupyter environment *wherever that environment is actually hosted*, {numref}`jl_local_file_list`

If you are mounting files from your host computer into a local VCE, you can ignore this extension. Its main benefit is to allow you to view and save files on your local computer when using a remote Juptyer VCE.
```

If you are accessing the computational environment via an OU hosted multi-user JupyterHub server, *your desktop files will be visible and editable within the browser*. When code is executed, it is sent to the OU server, executed there, and the result returned for display in the browser. The results of the computation are rendered in the notebook and those rendered outputs are saved back to the original notebook file on host filesystem.

Read and write permissions over the shared directory on the local filesystem are granted to the domain serving the environment for the duration of a browser session (i.e. as long as at least one tab is open onto the Jupyter server).

This extension works for both the hosted and local container environments, with the following consequences:

- *hosted environment*: students can work on files using the hosted environment that are resident on the student's local machine. This means that students can retain and work from a local copy of their files, rather than files that exist on the server:
  - advantages: for students who always access the remote environment using the same physical, computer, they will work with copies of files that exist on that computer; this means that a student can use a local environment *and* the hosted environment to work on *exactly* the same files.
  - disadvantages: if a student accesses the hosted environment from a different computer, their previously worked on files *will not* be available unless they were manually copied into the persistent file storage provided by the hosted environment.
