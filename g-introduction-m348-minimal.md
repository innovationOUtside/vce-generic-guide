# Introduction

In this module, you will use a module specific virtual computing environment (VCE) for some of the module activities. The VCE is provided in various alternative forms, which offer an equivalent computational environment:

- a hosted environment using the Open Computing Lab remote hosting service;
- accessed via the module VLE as a JupyterLite environment running in a browser based HTML5 application 
- a locally run environment distributed as a Docker container identical to the container used by the Open Computing Lab
- a locally run application that deploys the same JupyerLite environment as the VLE delivered HTML application.

The VCE provides a customised computing environment appropriate for your module and an interactive browser based user interface to access the software running inside it. The computational environments provided by each route provide equivalent Jupyter environments and execute the notebooks in the same way.
