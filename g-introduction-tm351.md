Two sections then follow that describe how to get started using JupyterLab ({numref}`g-vce_homepage_jupyterlab.md#using-the-vce-with-jupyterlab` {ref}`g-vce_homepage_jupyterlab.md#using-the-vce-with-jupyterlab`) and the Jupyter notebook environment ({numref}`g-vce_homepage_jupyter_nb_v7.md#using-the-vce-with-jupyterlab-notebook-v7` {ref}`g-vce_homepage_jupyter_nb_v7.md#using-the-vce-with-jupyterlab-notebook-v7`). An overview Jupyter notebook documents themselves is then provided ({numref}`g-working_with_jupyter_notebooks.md#working-with-jupyter-notebooks` {ref}`g-working_with_jupyter_notebooks.md#working-with-jupyter-notebooks`), along with how to handle common Jupyter notebook 'gotchas' ({numref}`nb:gotchas` {ref}`nb:gotchas`) and how to make notebooks more accessible to your needs ({numref}`g-accessibility_jupyterlab-nbv7.md#jupyter-notebook-accessibility` {ref}`g-accessibility_jupyterlab-nbv7.md#jupyter-notebook-accessibility`). {numref}`x-tm351-extras.md#additional-software` {ref}`x-tm351-extras.md#additional-software` describes several additional software applications provided in the VCE that are specific the TM351 (OpenRefine, PostgreSQL and MongoDB) and guidance on working with `git` and remote `git` repositories in {numref}`g-jupyterlab_git.md#using-git-and-github-in-jupyterlab` {ref}`g-jupyterlab_git.md#using-git-and-github-in-jupyterlab`. Practical advice then follows on using the Linux terminal / command line ({numref}`g-using-linux-command-line.md#using-the-terminal-command-line` {ref}`g-using-linux-command-line.md#using-the-terminal-command-line`), how to troubleshoot any issues that arise ({numref}`g-troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting` {ref}`g-troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting`), and how to obtain additional support if required ({numref}`g-additional-support.md#additional-support` {ref}`g-additional-support.md#additional-support`). An appendix reviews the technical architecture of the local VCE ({numref}`g-vce_technical_architecture.md#appendix-vce-technical-architecture` {ref}`g-vce_technical_architecture.md#appendix-vce-technical-architecture`).
